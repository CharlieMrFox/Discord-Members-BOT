# Discord-Members: BOT

A simple bot that effectively downloads all members of a Discord server using Discord API. 

After trying many options, I came out with this code that runs once and creates a list of Discord server members with one click (tested with 5K and less). 

This script considers all intents and Discord cache to avoid downloading the same member every time you run the code.

Remember to have a Discord Dev account to create the bot, get the bot token you should not share with anyone, the one that goes in the scriptâ€™s last line, and invite your newly created bot to the server you want to download the members from.

If you don't know where to run this code, you can use Visual Studio Code.
